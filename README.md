# About the Project

This project shows the website for the first homework assignment for my coding bootcamp
The website is hosted live on github pages through the following URL:
## https://dylan-stroud.github.io/Horiseon-edits/

This was edited with CSS and HTML, The page has not changed visibly but the source code has been changed and some redundancy was removed.
The CSS now follows a more semantic structure and an easy to read format has been added, separating the different secitions in the css file.
